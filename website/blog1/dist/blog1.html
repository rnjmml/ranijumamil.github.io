    With the increasing use of the tool called Artificial Intelligence, many experts in the IT field ask this same question, <b>“Will AI eventually replace us?”</b> With studying, coding, or even art having no difficulty with the use of AI, let me ask you this: <u>why do we depend on an algorithm?</u> Why has this tool become so powerful and necessary in our daily lives?</u>

    <h2 id="magic">The magic of AI</h2>
    <div class="bio-card">
  <p>
    One click and all your needed information is in the palm of your hand. While this may seem good, many people ignore the <b>negative effects</b> it can also have, not only on productivity but also on mindset. The fact that the user won’t have to work hard to get the output or information they need plants a certain habit in the brain. Once you start relying on AI, you may slowly stop thinking of doing the work yourself.

<p>There was once a kid who was a top student in her class, always joining essay writing contests where she would win most of the time. However, one day, the teacher gave the kid a topic where she did not have any idea what to write. Instead of thinking deeply or researching on her own, the girl decided to use AI to generate ideas for her essay. At first, it helped her overcome her difficulty, but over time she began to rely on AI more and more. <u>As a result, her creativity, critical thinking, and efficiency slowly decreased because she no longer challenged herself to think independently.</u> </p>

The moral lesson here is that while AI can be a helpful tool, overdependence on it can weaken a person’s ability to think, learn, and improve on their own. AI should assist human intelligence, not replace it.

    <div class="bio-card">
  <p>
    <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> is neither completely a friend nor entirely a foe—it depends on how we use it. When used <b>responsibly</b>, AI can support learning, creativity, and productivity. However, when relied on too heavily, it can reduce independence and critical thinking skills. A piece of advice, instead of letting AI do all the work for us, we should use it as a guide while continuing to develop our own abilities. In the end, AI should be a tool that helps humans grow, not one that makes them dependent.</u>
