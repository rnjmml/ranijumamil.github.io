    I used to think gaming was just something I did to pass time. I wasn’t the type of player who dreamed of climbing ranks or joining tournaments. I was just a casual gamer. But everything changed when I started watching professional CS:GO and Valorant players like Tenz, Shroud, etc. Seeing those players compete on stage, communicate flawlessly, and perform under pressure made me ask myself: What if I could be like them? That question became the start of a journey that made me realize gaming is more than just playing.

  <p>
    <p>Back when I was in senior high school, I decided to take gaming seriously. I grinded ranked games almost every day, studied strategies, improved my aim, and focused on teamwork. I pushed myself to reach the same level as the players I admired on screen. It wasn’t easy, but every improvement boosted my confidence, not just in-game, but also in how I communicated and worked with others.</p>

<p>Gaming taught me how important communication is. You can have the best skills, but without proper callouts, teamwork, and trust, you won’t win. Through competitive play, I learned how to stay calm under pressure, listen to others, and lead when needed. These are things I never expected to learn from a video game.</p>

<p>I also met many great friends along the way who supported me to keep improving. Playing with them made gaming more fun because of how we have the same hobby and humor.</p>
      <p>However, as time passed, I realized that becoming a professional player required sacrifices that I was not ready to make, especially when I started to feel that I can't handle both playing competitively and my academics. Accepting that my dream of going pro would remain just a dream was difficult and disappointing at first. Still, gaming helped me understand my priorities and what truly mattered to me in the long run.</p>

    Though I agree that gaming can be bad for you physically, but for me, it became a life lesson. It helped me build confidence, improve my communication with others, form friendships, and understand my own priorities. Even though I didn’t become a professional gamer, the experience shaped who I am today.

That’s why I believe gaming is more than just playing. Sometimes, it’s about discovering yourself, learning what you’re capable of, and understanding what truly matters in life.</u>
