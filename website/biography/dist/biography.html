    <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
    <div class="bio-card">
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Santa Maria, Bulacan, a place I only knew briefly.<sup>[1]</sup>
        I was raised in <u>San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan</u>, where most of my childhood memories were formed.<sup>[2]</sup>
        I lived with my family, which was always full of people and activity.<sup>[3]</sup>
        My family consists of my father, mother, brother, sister, and grandmother, who were all part of my daily life.<sup>[4]</sup>
        I also grew up close to my uncle and auntie, even though they did not live in the same house.<sup>[5]</sup>
        My father worked as a seaman, so he was not always home because of his long trips abroad.<sup>[6]</sup>
        Every time he came home, it felt exciting and special for all of us.<sup>[7]</sup>
        My mother was a housewife who took care of me and my siblings every day.<sup>[8]</sup>
        She made sure we were fed, disciplined, and guided as we grew up.<sup>[9]</sup>
        My grandmother also helped my mother in raising us, especially when my father was away.<sup>[10]</sup>
        At an early age, I became familiar with using a computer because I often saw my older brother playing with his laptop.<sup>[11]</sup>
        Watching him made me curious, so I eventually learned how to use it too.<sup>[12]</sup>
        Because of that, I spent a lot of my time playing computer games during my free time.<sup>[13]</sup>
        Aside from playing, I also studied and tried to do well in school.<sup>[14]</sup>
        I also played outside, especially basketball, which was a favorite activity among my friends.<sup>[15]</sup>
        I felt like I lived a simple, fun, and happy childhood.<sup>[16]</sup>
        That childhood shaped many of my interests today.<sup>[17]</sup>
        Those interests eventually influenced my college course.<sup>[18]</sup>
        My childhood in Bulacan gave me many valuable memories.<sup>[19]</sup>
        It will always be a big part of who I am.<sup>[20]</sup>

       <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
     <div class="bio-card">
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my teenage years, I studied at Jarmmeth Academy up until Grade 10.<sup>[1]</sup>
        Those years became a big part of who I am today.<sup>[2]</sup>
        When I reached senior high school, I eventually transferred to First City Providential College.<sup>[3]</sup>
        Adjusting to a new school was scary at first.<sup>[4]</sup>
        I slowly learned to adapt to the new environment.<sup>[5]</sup>
        One of my biggest challenges was choosing the right friends.<sup>[6]</sup>
        I experienced being in toxic friendship circles.<sup>[7]</sup>
        Some groups were fun and lively.<sup>[8]</sup>
        Others made me feel confused and stressed.<sup>[9]</sup>
        Despite that, I learned important lessons about trust.<sup>[10]</sup>
        I also learned how to set boundaries.<sup>[11]</sup>
        My hobbies still included playing online computer games.<sup>[12]</sup>
        I also played basketball with friends whenever we had free time.<sup>[13]</sup>
        Sometimes we set up chairs outside a friend’s house to chill.<sup>[14]</sup>
        We also traveled to nearby places just to relax.<sup>[15]</sup>
        As teenagers, we had limited freedom.<sup>[16]</sup>
        These years were when I met my first girlfriend.<sup>[17]</sup>
        It was a mix of excitement and nervousness.<sup>[18]</sup>
        I experienced my first heartbreak and rejection.<sup>[19]</sup>
        Those moments helped me grow emotionally.<sup>[20]</sup>

    <h2>College Years</h2>
    <div class="bio-card">
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took <b>Computer Science</b> in college because I was interested in technology.<sup>[1]</sup>
        My first year felt manageable and welcoming.<sup>[2]</sup>
        The environment helped me adjust easily.<sup>[3]</sup>
        I met my first college friend.<sup>[4]</sup>
        I also met many students from different places.<sup>[5]</sup>
        Each person had their own story.<sup>[6]</sup>
        I learned a lot from listening to them.<sup>[7]</sup>
        One memorable part of my first year was our NSTP subject.<sup>[8]</sup>
        We visited a place in Manila.<sup>[9]</sup>
        We distributed relief goods to people in need.<sup>[10]</sup>
        It was a meaningful experience.<sup>[11]</sup>
        That activity taught me the value of community service.<sup>[12]</sup>
        Commuting to school was tiring.<sup>[13]</sup>
        It took nearly three hours both ways.<sup>[14]</sup>
        I eventually grew used to the long travel.<sup>[15]</sup>
        Looking out the bus window became part of my routine.<sup>[16]</sup>
        It gave me time to think.<sup>[17]</sup>
        I felt proud of managing my responsibilities.<sup>[18]</sup>
        My independence improved during my first year.<sup>[19]</sup>
        It was a meaningful start to my college journey as a <strong>Computer Science</strong> student.<sup>[20]</sup>
