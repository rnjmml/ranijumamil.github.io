  <p>
    As I progress in my IT journey, I aim to develop strong technical skills that align with industry demands. I want to work in an environment where my knowledge is valued and where I can contribute meaningfully to projects and solutions. A hybrid work setup is something I strongly desire, such as working four days in the office and two or three days at home. This balance would help me stay productive while also giving me time to rest and recharge. Having flexibility in my work schedule would allow me to manage stress better and maintain a healthy work-life balance. In this stage of my career, I want to accomplish many things, such as mastering new technologies, collaborating with professionals, and continuously improving myself.</u>
